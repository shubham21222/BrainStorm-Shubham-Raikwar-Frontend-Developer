# Food Menu Webpage

## Technical Assignment | Frontend Developer

Welcome to the Food Menu Webpage project! This is an exciting opportunity for you to showcase your front-end development skills. The goal of this assignment is to build an engaging landing page for a Food Menu App using React. Let's dive into the details!

## Overview

Your main goal is to create a Food Menu Webpage with various sections, including Filters, Food items, Header, and Footer. You'll utilize the Food API available at [The Meal DB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) and mimic the design, colors, and theme of [Swiggy](https://www.swiggy.com/) for a cohesive look. The application should be fully responsive and compatible across various screen sizes.

## Key Components

### Header Section

- The header contains the logo and a search bar (non-functional) for searching restaurants and food items.

### Filters Section

- This section allows users to filter food items by area.
- Upon clicking the "Filter" tag, a dropdown is displayed with options to filter by area.
- Users can select an area, and clicking "Apply" dynamically updates the Food Items Section with matching food items from that area.
- Sorting functionality allows users to sort food items alphabetically.

### Food Items Section (Data Grid)

- The default view displays all Indian food items from the API.
- Each food item card includes an image, name, and randomly generated ratings.
- Clicking on a food item opens a modal with additional details about the selected item.
- Pagination is incorporated to manage large datasets.

### Footer Section

- The footer balances the bottom of the webpage and includes the logo and copyright information.
